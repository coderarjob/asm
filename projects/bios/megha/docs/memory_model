MEMORY MODEL OF MEGHA OPERATING SYSTEM
------------------------------------------------------------

The OS Kernel would itself be loaded in a single segment, but can call drivers 
loaded in different segment. The system calls of the OS can only be accessed by 
the INT instruction.

All of the segment registers is preserved during system calls.
If any system call procedure needs to access local table/data it can change DS
register, but must be restored back.
