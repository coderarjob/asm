; Megha Operating System Panic/Debug module.
; The functions in this file is called by the kernel, drivers or application
; programs.
; Build version: 0.1 (100819)
;
; Initial release: 10th Aug 2019
; 

; Every driver and application programs start at location 0x64
; The above area (0 to 0x63) is for future use, and not used currently.
	ORG 0x64

; The first function in a driver program is a _init function. This function is
; responsible for setting up the driver - install routines into IVT etc.
